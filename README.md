# CovariateAdjustedDiffNetwork
Covariate-adjusted inference for differential analysis of high-dimensional networks.

Implementation of a hypothesis test for identifying differences between two biological network, e.g., to detect differences in gene co-expression networks that correspond to different disease conditions.  See more details in the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08704).
